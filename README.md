# trivia-game
This timed trivia game is based on your knowledge of the Harry Potter Series.  

In this project, I created a simple trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate the HTML.  => It only shows one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.  

=> If the play selects the correct answer and the corresponding giphy and a congratulations!

=>  If the player selects the wrong answer, the game will tell the player that the answer was incorrect and again will show the correct answer.

=> On the final screen, the player is shown the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game without reloading.
